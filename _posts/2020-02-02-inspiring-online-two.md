*I've remade inspiring online, with a focus on a slightly longer format.*

I'd first made [inspiring online](http://tholman.com/post/inspiring-online/) in late 2016, and had kept it fairly busy into 2018, and then dropped off completely.

I've decided to do a revival, with a little longer format of the posts. Partially because I've been putting a little more effort into writing, and trying to improve on it, and partially because I feel that I have the knowledge to give some fun insights into some of these things.

The refresh also has come with a fresh redesign, to accommodate the longer format of writing.

I've rebuilt the code from scratch, moving it from jekyll to hugo, which is a lot faster. And hosted it on Netlify, for quick and easy deployment.
