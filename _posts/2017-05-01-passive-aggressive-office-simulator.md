*"Remember everybody, the crisper is for green vegetables only, anything else found in it will be thrown out at the end of the day." ~ Passive aggressive post-it note.*

One of the funnier things I found from office life was the small messages that would blast out to the whole company "There's a fire drill tomorrow.", "The coffee machine on the first floor is broken" etc. Now that I'm working remotely, in a weird way, I miss them. As such, the passive agressive office simulator Slackbot was born.
