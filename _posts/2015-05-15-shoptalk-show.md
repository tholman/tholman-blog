*Talking shop with Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier.*

[Shoptalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com) is one of those super well established podcasts, with a great history of speakers. Was fantastic to be a part of it.

Its sometimes really nice to sit back and reflect on the journey that you've taken to get to where you are today.

**Edit:** Also, who would have known, a year or so later, and Chris is my boss at CodePen.
