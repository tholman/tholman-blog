*Had a blast at JSConf Asia! I've been talking about the journey of creation for a while now, and am always changing how I want to present it. This is one of my favorite renditions.*

Honestly, JSConf Asia was really top notch this year, I met an incredible group of developers from all different backgrounds. Could barely sleep afterwards. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of going!
