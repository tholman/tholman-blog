*The Versioning Show discusses the industry of the web from development to design, with some of the people making it happen today, and planning where it's headed in the next version.*

The opening question of the versioning show ask which version of "myself" am I currently, which is an awesomely unique way of kicking off a podcast.

Its always great when a podcast just flows nice and easy, all credit to Tim and David there for being awesome hosts.

**EDIT:** Looks like the audio's dropped off from this now... can still read the script though, if you're a hyper fan!
