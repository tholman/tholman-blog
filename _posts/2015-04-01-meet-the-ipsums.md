*A website to collect and display all the wonderful filler text generators in the world.*

[Meet The Ipsums](http://meettheipsums.com) was built over a week or so, with the designs and direction coming from good friend, and awesome designer [Claudio Guglieri](http://www.guglieri.com/).

I've always been a collector, this website showcases filler text. It turns out there's alot of them... Cat ipsum, coffee ipsum, Ryan Gosling ipsum... the list goes on!

Its always a fun time building things with friends, but then also opening up the website for submissions via [GitHub](https://github.com/tholman/meettheipsums).
