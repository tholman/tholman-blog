*New fonts and colors with every new tab!*

[Palettab](http://palettab.com/) (palette ~ Tab) is a chrome extension built with my wonderful friend [Claudio Guglieri](http://www.guglieri.com/). The thought here, is that every time you open a new tab, you will be greeted with a beautiful color palette, and a selection of fonts you haven't seen yet.

The fonts are all available via Google Fonts, and the colors come from [Colour Lovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/). There are thousands of combinations, so its rare that you would recognize two of the same, even after using it for months.

Of course, we built a small webpage for sharability as well!

To date, the extension has around 30 thousand active users, which feels great.
