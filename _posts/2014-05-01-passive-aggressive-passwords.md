*Imagine your in-laws are helping you with a password... this is what they'd say.*

I always irk a little inside, when a machine tells me something that I've done is wrong. The most common form of that, is probably passwords. "Your password is too weak", "Your password needs to contain a number and a special character".

While I absolutely understand why they need to be this way (they're looking out for us!) ... that said, its the jarring interaction that I wanted to focus on. What if they said meaner and meaner things. Thats what this website is all about.

This was done in collab with a new friend of mine, [Tobias](http://www.vanschneider.com/), who worked with me on the designs and interactions.
