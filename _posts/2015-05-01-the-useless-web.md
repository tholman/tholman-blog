*Take me to a useless website!*

While I was stuck indoors during hurricane Sandy, in 2015, I went down a strange rabbit hole of weird websites. Some of them didn't seem like they should exist at all, and some (like [eelslap](http://eelslap.com/)) were incredibly perplexing.

I gathered as many of these sites as I could, and put them all into a small website, which I called [The Useless Web](http://www.theuselessweb.com/).

It was through this simplicity that the website gained popularity, hundreds of thousand visitors a month!
