*Sometimes you find a few hours free in your life, and try to fit a little project into that.*

Console dot frog is perhaps my most important creation to date. No longer shall I debug with the simple monotony of regular logs... for now, there are frogs.

So, here is a simple explaination. I think its supreme utility speaks for itself.


```javascript
// Here is you, logging some logs
console.log("Boring.");
```

```
// And here is your output.
Boring.
```

And here is how `console.frog` can improve your life.

```javascript
// Here is happy you, logging some logs
console.frog("Amazing!");
```

```
// And here is your output.
          _,-.     ------------
  ,-. ,--'  o ) -(   Amazing!   )
  \(,' '  ,,-'     ------------
 ,-.\-.__,\\_
 \(`--'    `\
```

Truly life changing.
