*Sometimes you find a few hours free in your life, and try to fit a little project into that.*

Console dot frog is perhaps my most important creation to date. No longer shall I debug with the simple monotony of regular logs... for now, there are frogs.

So, here is a simple explaination. I think its supreme utility speaks for itself.


```javascript
// Here is you, logging some logs
console.log("Boring.");
```

```javascript
// And here is your output.
Boring.
```
