*Draw with text!*

[Texter](http://tholman.com/texter/) is a small experiment, where I moved a Flash project from a book, over to JavaScript... it really helped me focus on the language, rather than what I was making. Comparing how Flash rendered items, to how the JS canvas does it.

You can see a small pic above, but I really recommend checking out the live demo. There's a link to the source below too... some cool stuff in there about the speed of mouse movement, and angles of direction.
