*A small library for console based easter eggs.*

When I'm building websites, I like to put in easter eggs here and there. For the most part, I get personal enjoyment out of it, although I guess its a weird way of procrastination.

DOM animator animates a small ASCII image within the code of the page, which will be visible when someone is inspecting the source. Great for getting the attention of developers, or for overall fun.
