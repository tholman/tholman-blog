*A little music player, with a binary twist.*

A while ago, I stumbled onto [this]() beautiful video. A music player that counted up with binary, playing notes on each particular 1, and being silent on each particular 0. In the video (which I do think everyone should listen to!) the creator has also added some background sounds, and is also using real piano notes, so it is definitely a lot more beautiful. 

That said, it was still something that I wanted to replicate on the web, using [Tone.JS]().

I also went ahead and added the ability to customize the notes, and share the individual creations with others via url parameters.

There wasn't really any need to use a framework (other than Tone.JS of course), so its all relatively vanilla JavaScript, so if you take a peek at the code, it shouldn't be too insane.
