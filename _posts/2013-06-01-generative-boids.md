*A small experiment in combining flocking algorithms with line art.*

In this [experiment](http://tholman.com/generative-boids/), I combined some flocking algorithms I found online, with some open source "brushes", borrowed from this [cool drawing project](http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/)

The brushes work by saving single coordinates on the canvas, and then cross checking themselves with every other stored coordinate... they then apply different behaviours based on their proximity to the others.

Clicking on the screen with change the "brush", as well as some of the properties of the flocking logic... this means the possible outcomes are pretty much endless.

I really love these clean canvas experiments. Somehow finishing them up feels like I've made something "complete".
