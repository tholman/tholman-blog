*A website that gives people the finger. No tricks here.*

A little quick collab with my friend [Guy Trefler](https://www.guytrefler.com/).

Actually I lied, there are some cool tricks here! I always say you can learn something even from the most simple projects, and "The Finger" is no exception.

I needed to look into translating between one color and another. I read into this, and made sure I understood all the math. In the end, used an answer from Stack Overflow (because why re-invent the wheel), but at the same time, its always important to understand what you're putting into your site, especially if you're copy pasting.

**EDIT:** I also recieved an awesome [pull request](https://github.com/tholman/thats-the-finger/pull/1), allowing you to tilt your phone, to effect the ammount of finger the page is giving. Check it out on your phone.
