*A small experiment into hiding tweet and facebook buttons, until they're truly needed.*

I've never been too crazy about social media, but there's no denying that having a Facebook or Twitter button on your site can be a nice little boost. 

These buttons are the result of a small experimentation, checking to see if I could hide them discreetly, but still have them active and available on the page if someone wanted them.

![Example 1](./images/discreet-1.gif)

The idea generally was to show a small icon, and then reveal the actual twitter button.

There are so many different ways this could be taken.
