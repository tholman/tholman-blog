*I've open sourced the magic behind the generative artistry website, aptly named tutorial markdown*

[Tutorial Markdown](https://github.com/tholman/tutorial-markdown) is a javascript library that reads onto a small extension of markdown syntax, allowing for self coding tutorials [like these](https://generativeartistry.com)

Interactive blogging is something that had been on my mind for a long time, so it was great to finally get this out. It involved really picking apart the way that we write code, and finding a way we can explain it in terms that aren't overwhelming at all.

I've added a lot of documentation in there as well, but of course am happy to help anyone getting started!
