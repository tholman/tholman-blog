*A 10 minute talk about the making of a ~~murderer~~ mosquito.*

[Making the mosquito](https://tholman.com/post/mosquito-js/) was one thing, though after it's creation it didn't feel quite right leaving the project alone.

That's when the amazing [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/) came along. Bang Bang Con is one of my favorite conferences each year, focusing on small bite-sized projects and often showcasing people being super creative within speedy 10-minute talks. And they were interested in my mosquito!

You can watch the talk on youtube!

If you enjoyed that, I definitely recommend watching some of the other talks of the two-day conference, both are available via their [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEZ0N0rrbL0) [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EReoVpb9LJo).

What's next for the mosquito? Only time will tell.
