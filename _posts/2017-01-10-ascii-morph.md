*While playing around with ASCII art, I explored animating one image to another.*

AsciiMorph is a small JS library designed to transition between two ascii images for an old website of mine.

The library counts the spaces around the "image" and then systematically collapses it from the outside inwards. 

Rather than just hiding the bordered ascii characters, they are replaced by a series of slashes and stars, which gives a general collapsing effect.
