*Things you probably didn't know about, in 5 minutes or less!*

I recently "bumped" into [bumpers.fm](http://bumpers.fm), a cool little app for recording small audio casts. I figured why not, and so "[OK, Get This](http://bumpers.fm/ok)" was born.

The goal of this "podcast" is to highlight weird and wonderful events, happenings and coincidences in the world, and then talk about them for 5 minutes or less.

For example, The Emu Wars in Australia, or the history of tug-o-war fatalities, yikes!

The individual episodes are also embeddable, which is cool, and make for nice little sharable snippets.

**EDIT:** I've began exploring [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/ok) as another possible outlet for new episodes. In the app there are saved "episodes", though it doesn't seem like the website offers it yet.
