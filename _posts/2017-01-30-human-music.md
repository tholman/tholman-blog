*This is earth radio, and now here's human music.*

In season x, episode y of Rick and Morty, there's a particular scene where Jerry is listening to the radio in the car, within a simulation of earth running at 5%, as he listens to the music it plays close to the most simplistic audio you could imagine.

I fired up ole Garage Band and had a go at [re-creating it](https://soundcloud.com/twholman/sets/driving-home-with-human-music), and a few more inspired versions.

All up, I made 7 or so "human music" pieces, and wacked them together into an album for my soundcloud debut!

And of course, any project wouldn't be complete without a little sharable [web page](http://tholman.com/human-music).
