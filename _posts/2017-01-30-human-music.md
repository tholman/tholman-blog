*A full album of "Rick and Morty" inspired human music.*

In season x, episode y of Rick and Morty, there's a particular scene where Jerry is listening to the radio in the car, within a simulation of earth running at 5%, as he listens to the music it plays close to the most simplistic audio you could imagine.

I fired up ole bandcamp and had a go at re-creating it, and a few more inspired versions.

All up, I made 7 or so "human music" pieces, and wacked them together into an album for my soundcloud debut!
