*A Zen text editor, for maximum writing peace.*

[ZenPen](http://www.zenpen.io/) is a simple text editor, that I built based off the medium editor back in 2013. 

As it turns out, building things with the rich text editing api can be a super frustrating experience, but on the flipped side, building something on top of it is super rewarding.

ZenPen remains one of my most popular open source projects, it combines a lot of cool web APIs to bring the product together. It was also a explore designing something with a minimal interface.
