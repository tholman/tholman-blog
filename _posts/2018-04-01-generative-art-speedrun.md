*I've had a big swing into generative art lately, and this talk has been a big part of my research, discovery and exploration.*

This video is from JSConf Australia, when I first gave this talk. Since then, I've given it in a lot of different formats, and from a lot of different angles, including workshops and lightning talks. Generative art is rich with avenue's for exploration, inspiration and all round fun!
