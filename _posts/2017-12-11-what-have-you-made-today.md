*Got a little sick of my old "new tab" page, so I built something small to replace it.*

The idea of this little project was to build something that replaced the default "Chrome" new tabs page, which, although good, would be a little frustrating at times... it would load a whole google search bar, when really I was using the browsers URL bar to search anyway. It was also sending off requests this way and the next, which weren't really neccesary.

All I really wanted was a simple speed dial, and some motivational text. So thats what I did!

One pleasant surprise, was that the FireFox addon's use exactly the same api's as Chrome, and that there is a [whole documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) amongst browsers, about how to implement said extensions. Yay for standards!
