*A podcast about generative art, to go with the interactive tutorials!*

Last year, [Ruth](https://twitter.com/Rumyra) reached out to me and proposed the idea of a generative art podcast!

We mulled over the idea for a few months, and then put [together a format](https://anchor.fm/generative-art) that we thought would be fun for us to create, as well as educational and inspiring for others.

We've got some great guests coming on.

As well as some short chats, where we kind of completely got off-topic and found the chat interesting enough to publish.

We've combined the podcast into the [generative artistry](https://generativeartistry.com) site, so you can get all your tutorials and blog posts in the same place.

The podcast is available in all the cool places too!
