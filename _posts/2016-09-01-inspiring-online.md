*A project aimed at creating a simple inspirational open source blog, that could be a launching point for people beginning to look at git/github and contributing to open source!*

This blog was a fun little one to create, the aim of giving myself a simple area that I can share inspiring and creative work as well as a simple repository that I could use to help people kick off contributing to open source, either in person or online.

The design was a fairly simple [isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) layout (thanks Dave!), and dark color scheme... really, the content speaks for itself.

This is the kind of project that grows slowly, but always has a place in my day-to-day life... fixing bugs/helping new contributors/adding new sites.

On the extra nerdy side, I have a [script](https://gist.github.com/tholman/6bc63a150f218bd3b001c6c8ad70e80e) that I use to add posts from the command line. This creates the new post file, setting the date, and linking the image files needed to add a new post. Its not really needed, but means that I can create a new post without opening the text editor, or manually moving images around.
