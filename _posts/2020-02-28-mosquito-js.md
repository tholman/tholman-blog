*In an attempt to learn a little more about the web audio API, I created a mosquito from nothing!*

This bite sized weekend project started out innocent enough, I wanted to mimic the noise of a mosquito using tech on the web.

The initial steps were easy. Listen to some mosquito videos on youtube (yes, they exist!). Create an oscillator to mimic the most annoying mosquito pitch possible. Then, get into the mind of the mosquito, to create the random pitch and volume variations that drive someone insane.

I had originally planned to build this out like an API, so people could add mosquitos to their website. Maybe hook it into the mouse movements, so you could "play" the mosquito so to speak, but the very act of creating it sent me insane.

I documented the [journey](https://github.com/tholman/mosquito-js).
