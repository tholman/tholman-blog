*Experimenting with Image data in the canvas. There's always fun to be had!*

This is one of my earliest experiments (of course writing this from the future), that said there were a lot of great things to learn.

The canvas is (was) fresh to the web, and there was (still is!) a lot of experimenting to do. In these experiments I am loading image data in and checking it in the format of a grid (which color is this pixel, 10 pixels from the top and left, 20 pixels from the top and left, 30 pixels etc)

From that data, I decide certain things, "how dark is this", or "what color is this" and then made different renderings from that information.

The custom controls here are using [DAT.GUI](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage), which is a great utility to use when building projects that have lots of workable variables.

I've added both of these projects to [CodePen](https://codpen.io/tholman), where you can play with, and edit the source.
