*Intense Images is a full screen modal built for high definition images.*

The [Intense Images](http://tholman.com/intense-images/) library came out as part of the [Aquatilis](http://aquatilis.tv/aquatilis-expedition/) project. It allows you to click on images, and experience them within the full browser window, with little to no overhead.

You can see it active in the image above, but I really recommend checking out the live demo, to get the full experience.
